  <div class="post-content">
    <h1 id="terms-of-use">Terms of Use</h1>

<h2 id="1-your-use-of-open-source-software">1. Your Use of Open Source Software</h2>

<p>We may make (but are not obligated to make) the source code of Kaia Blockchain Network Platform (“Platform”), the software on the Platform, etc. for download as open source software. If you use this open source software, you agree to be bound by and comply with any license that applies to this open source software. You will not indicate that you are associated with us in connection with your use, modifications or distributions of this open source software.</p>

<h2 id="2-services-provided-on-the-platform">2. Services Provided on the Platform</h2>

<p>The Platform is a combination of peer-to-peer subnetworks of nodes transmitting transactions and blocks to execute value transfers and run smart contracts. The Core Cell Network (“CCN”), which is one of the subnetworks that constitute the Platform, verifies and executes transactions that occur on the Platform. The CCN is operated by Kaia Governance Council, which is a collective group of Core Cell Operators, and Kaia is not directly involved in any services that are provided in or individual transactions that occur on the Platform.</p>

<h2 id="3-your-installation-of-bapp-on-the-platform">3. Your Installation of BApp on the Platform</h2>

<p>Your use of open source software is free of charge. However, you may be required to pay a certain number of KLAY as a transaction fee in order to execute a transaction on the Platform, including the installation of the BApp on the Platform.</p>

<p>Once transaction is executed successfully and respective block generation is verified successfully by the Platform’s mechanism, the block is irreversibly stored in the blockchain. As such, your installation of the BApp and any other transactions on the Platform, as well as the submission of transaction fee is final and irrevocable.</p>

<h2 id="4-user-content">4. User Content</h2>

<p>If you or the users of your BApp post, upload, input, provide or submit any content on the Platform (collectively, your “User Content”), you must ensure that the User Content provided by you or the users of your BApp at that or at any other time is true, accurate, up to date and complete and that any User Content you or the users of your BApp post, upload, input, provide or submit via the Platform do not breach or infringe legal rights of any third party. To the extent that is technically possible, you agree to prevent, remove or block access of any User Content that you or the users of your BApp post, upload, input, provide or submit via the Platform that violate or may violate legal rights (such as rights of privacy and publicity) of others or any applicable laws or regulations. We do not own, control or endorse any User Content that is transmitted, stored or processed via the Platform or sent to us and we are not responsible or liable for any User Content. We make no assurance that any of Your Content will be secured or that such content will remain confidential.</p>

<p>You are solely responsible and liable for all of your User Content and for your use of any interactive features, links or information or content on the Platform, and you represent and warrant that (i) you own all intellectual property rights (or have obtained all necessary permissions) to provide your User Content and to grant the licenses in these Terms of Use; (ii) your User Content will not violate any agreements or confidentiality obligations; and (iii) your User Content will not violate, infringe or misappropriate any intellectual property right or other proprietary right, including the right of publicity or privacy, of any person or entity.</p>

<p>You shall not include in User Content, or upload, transmit to or create or include in the Services environment any production data or any sensitive, proprietary, confidential or other data with particular data protection requirements such as personal data or personally identifiable information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.</p>

<p>You are prohibited from using the Platform to post or transmit any threatening, libellous, defamatory, obscene, scandalous, inflammatory, pornographic or profane material, any material that is contrary to applicable local, federal, or international laws and regulations, or any material that could constitute or encourage unlawful conduct. You must ensure that your User Content do not include such materials. We may from time to time monitor or review material transmitted or posted using the Network, and we reserve the right to delete any material we deem inappropriate.</p>

<p>We are under no obligation to do so and assume no responsibility or liability arising from any material transmitted or posted using the Platform.</p>

<p>You understand that any information you or users of your BApp upload to the Platform will be distributed among the blockchain nodes and may not removable due to technical limitations of the blockchain technology.</p>

<p>You are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account or your BApp (if any). You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your User Content, your BApp or account or any other breach of security. We will not be liable for any loss or damages that you may incur as a result of someone else using your User Content, your BApp or account, either with or without your knowledge. However, you could be held liable for losses incurred by us or another party due to someone else using your User Content, your BApp or account. You may not use anyone else’s User Content, your BApp or account at any time without the permission of such person or entity.</p>

<p>By posting, uploading, inputting, providing or submitting your User Content to the Platform, you grant to participants of the Platform and any necessary sub-licensees a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, right and permission to use, reproduce, copy, edit, modify, translate, reformat, create derivative works from, distribute, transmit, publicly perform and publicly display your User Content and sub-license such rights to others.</p>

<p>If we have reason to believe that there is likely to be a breach of security, breach or misuse of the Platform or if you breach any of your obligations under these terms, we may suspend your use of the Platform at any time and for any reason.</p>

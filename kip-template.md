<!--
  READ KIP-1 (https://kips.kaia.io/KIPS/kip-1) BEFORE USING THIS TEMPLATE!

  This is the suggested template for new KIPs. After you have filled in the requisite fields, please delete these comments.

  Note that an KIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your KIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `kip-draft_title_abbrev.md`.

  The title should be 44 characters or less. It should not repeat the KIP number in title, irrespective of the category.

## Abstract
<!--
  The Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph ~200 word) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.

## Motivation
<!--
    The motivation is critical for KIPs that want to change the Kaia protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the KIP solves. KIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

    With a few exceptions, external links are not allowed. If you feel that a particular resource would demonstrate a compelling case for your KIP, then save it as a printer-friendly PDF, put it in the assets folder, and link to that copy.

## Specification
<!--
    The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Kaia platforms (kaia).

## Rationale
<!--
    The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

## Backwards Compatibility
<!-- 
    All KIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The KIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. KIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright. The authors should answer the question: "Does this KIP require a hard fork?"

## Test Cases
<!--
    Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for KIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other KIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.

## Implementation
<!--
    The implementations must be completed before any KIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the KIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.

## Security Considerations

<!--
  All KIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. For example, include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. KIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An KIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

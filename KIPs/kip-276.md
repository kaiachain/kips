## Abstract

Add a new api endpoint to fetch the configuration for each fork. This KIP focuses on describing the difference from [EIP-7910](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7910.md).

## Motivation

Increases transparency of configuration values ​​for each fork by adding an `eth_config` api endpoint.
This API will allow users to check that their node are ready for the next fork and that the current fork configuration values ​​are correct.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

All clients constraints directly under the specification follow [EIP-7910](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7910.md).

### Configuration RPC

A new JSON-RPC API, `eth_config`, is introduced. It takes no parameters and returns the result object specified in the next section.

### Result Object Structure

The RPC result object structure follows [EIP-7910](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7910.md).

### Members of the Configuration Object

The members of the configuration object follow that of [EIP-7910](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7910.md) except for the following fields.

#### `activationTime`

The result MUST NOT have any `activationTime` field.

#### `blobSchedule`

The blob configuration parameters for the specific fork will be represented as specified in [EIP-7910](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7910.md). If [EIP-4844](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-4844.md) isn't implemented in the fork, the `blobSchedule` field MUST be `null`.

#### `forkId`

The `forkId` follows that of [EIP-7910](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7910.md), i.e. the `FORK_HASH` format as specified in [EIP-6122](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-6122.md).

#### `precompiles`

The precompiles follows that of [EIP-7910](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7910.md).

On top of Ethereum precompiles, some Kaia's precompiles may appear in this field.
The contract names are (in order): `VMLOG`, `FEE_PAYER`, `VALIDATE_SENDER`

`FEE_PAYER` and `VALIDATE_SENDER` values ​​of `0xa` and `0xb` deployed in Byzantine are ignored.

If any new precompiles are added, the EIP or KIP about the precompiles SHOULD state the names.

#### `systemContracts`

A JSON object representing the system-level contracts defined by EIPs and KIPs.
These have keys that are alphabetically sorted contract names (e.g., ADDRESS_BOOK) and values ​​that are 20-byte addresses.

System contracts whose address is hardcoded MUST appear in the result. Conversly, if a system contract address is stored in other contract's variables (e.g. [KIP-247 GaslessSwapRouter](https://github.com/kaiachain/kips/blob/main/KIPs/kip-247.md) is referenced from [KIP-149 Registry](https://github.com/kaiachain/kips/blob/main/KIPs/kip-149.md)), it SHALL NOT appear in the result.

The system contracts from genesis are (in order) `MAINNET_CREDIT`, `ADDRESS_BOOK`.
Note that `MAINNET_CREDIT` is only included if the genesis hash matches mainnet's one.

For Kip103, the added system contract is `KIP103`

For Kip160, the added system contract is `KIP160`

For Randao, the added system contract is `REGISTRY`.

For Prague, the added system contract is `HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS`.

If new system contracts are added at hardcoded addresses, the EIP or KIP about the system contracts SHOULD state the names.

### Blob Parameter Only Forks

Blob Parameter Only Forks do not exist in kaia, so this is ignored.

## Rationale

### activationTime field

Because Kaia uses block numbers, not timestamps to specify fork activation, so there is no suitable value to return for this field. If the block number is returned, it can be interpreted as a timestamp in the long past. If zero is returned, it can be interpreted as genesis activation.

However, if the field is absent, the SDK will explicitly know that the activationTime is absent. For instance, in Javascript, it will be `result.current.activationTime === undefined`, and `undefined` cannot be converted to numbers.

### `FEE_PAYER` and `VALIDATE_SENDER` in Byzantine

The following precompiles, which were deployed in byzantim, are now also deployed to addresses `0x3fe` and `0x3ff`.

| address | precompile |
| ------- | ---------- |
| 0xa | `FEE_PAYER` |
| 0xb | `VALIDATE_SENDER`|

This means that `FEE_PAYER` and `VALIDATE_SENDER` are deployed to two addresses. However, for JSON structure compatibility with Ethereum, from istanbul onwards, only addresses `0x3fe` and `0x3ff` will be returned for these addresses.

### System contracts are returned or not

Only a subset of Kaia's system contracts are returned from this API.
- If its address is hardcoded, it can be returned because the address never changes. e.g. AddressBook at 0x400, Registry at 0x401.
- If its address is stored as a variable in other contracts, it must not be returned. The address can change at any time regardless of hardfork. e.g. contracts like GaslessSwapRouter and CLRegistry are referenced from Registy and can be changed at any time by transaction.

## Backwards Compatibility

This does not affect the backward compatibility because this does not involve hardfork.

## Test Cases

#### Sample JSON-RPC

##### With Future Fork Scheduled

The following RPC command, issued on Kairos when Prague was scheduled but not activated:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_config","id":1}' http://localhost:8545
```

would return (after formatting):

```JSON

## Simple Summary

An unpredictable and verifiable proposer selection policy

## Abstract

This standard outlines an approach for a random proposer selection policy. A proposer is determined every block in a random manner. The randomness relies on [KIP-114](https://github.com/klaytn/kips/blob/main/KIPs/kip-114.md), thereby rendering the new policy both unpredictable and verifiable.

## Motivation

Klaytn has adopted the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanism, where a block proposer selected by a deterministic algorithm proposes the next block. A vulnerable point of BFT is that an adversary can effectively halt the entire network by simply targeting the proposer, a.k.a. targeted DoS. What makes Klaytn even more vulnerable to a targeted DoS attack is that the current proposer selection policy enables the prediction of up to `proposerRefreshInterval` (3600 in case of Cypress) number of proposers in advance.

As of now, a targeted DoS is practically infeasible in Klaytn because it is a permissioned chain which allows only authorized validators to join the network. However, in permissionless network, a targeted DoS is a viable option for attackers. A random proposer selection can increase the difficulty of the attack by introducing an uncertainty of the upcoming proposers.

Meanwhile, a few malicious validators must not be able to forge the randomness to arbitrarily determine the upcoming proposers. If not, it may increase the risk of censorship or monopolizing block rewards. Therefore, the new random proposer selection policy should be both unpredictable and verifiable.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### Parameters

| Constant     | Value |
| ------------ | ----- |
| `FORK_BLOCK` | TBD   |

### Shuffling

A shuffling algorithm must be defined which will act as a building block of proposer and committee selection.

[Fisher-Yates shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle) must be used in the below pseudocode (i.e., `random.shuffle`), and [Golang's RNG](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/master:src/math/rand/rng.go;l=7-12) must be used as a pseudo random number generator internally in Fisher-Yates.

`seed` is `mixHash[0:8]` interpreted as the bytes of a big-endian signed 64-bit integer. The `mixHash` (from [KIP-114](https://github.com/klaytn/kips/blob/main/KIPs/kip-114.md)) of the previous block is used (i.e., previous to the target block).

```py
def shuffle_validators_KIP146(validators: list[int], round: int, seed: int):
    tmp = validators[:]
    ret = []

    random.seed(seed)
    random.shuffle(tmp)
    ret.append(tmp[0])

    for i in range(round):
        tmp = tmp[i + 1 :]
        if len(tmp) == 0:
            break
        random.shuffle(tmp)
        ret.append(tmp[0])
    return ret
```

### Proposer selection

For calculating the proposer of `FORK_BLOCK` and afterward, the new logic must be used.
This only affects the chain whose proposer selection policy is set to `WeightedRandom`.

This design allows a certain validator to be selected as the proposer for consecutive blocks, while guaranteeing another proposer to be selected in case of round change.

```py
def proposer_selector(validators, round, seed):
    return shuffle_validators_KIP146(validators, round, seed)[round % len(validators)]
```

### Committee selection

For calculating the committee of `FORK_BLOCK` and afterward, the new logic must be used.
This only affects the chain whose proposer selection policy is set to `WeightedRandom`.

This design guarantees that the given proposer address is always in the committee.

```py
class View:
    sequence: int
    round: int

def select_committee_KIP146(validators, committee_size, seed, round):
    shuffled = shuffle_validators_KIP146(validators, round, seed)
    return (shuffled[round:] + shuffled[:round])[:committee_size]

def compute_committee(validators, committee_size, proposer, view, seed):
    committee = select_committee_KIP146(validators, committee_size, seed, view.round)
    if proposer not in committee:
        committee = committee[:-1] + proposer
    return committee
```

## Rationale

### Using part of `mixHash` as a seed

As defined in [KIP-114](https://github.com/klaytn/kips/blob/main/KIPs/kip-114.md), `mixHash` is the result of XOR operation with a keccak256 hash.
To the best of our knowledge, truncating the cryptographic hash is safe to be used for the seed of pseudo random number generator.
Ethereum also uses the first eight bytes of a hash: [link](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#compute_shuffled_index).

### Side effect

The current algorithm for composing a committee makes sure that the proposer and the next round proposer is included in the committee. Before `FORK_BLOCK`, the next round proposer is equal to the next block proposer, and thus the next block proposer always ended up in the committee. However, after `FORK_BLOCK`, the next round proposer can be different from the next block proposer, which may result in the next block proposer not being included from the committee. This side effect does not degrade the network security; while the next proposer being in the committee could potentially be helpful to next block generation, its significance is negligible, if any.

## Backwards Compatibility

The proposer selection policy before `FORK_BLOCK` remains the same.

## Security Considerations

### Biasability

The biasability of this proposal relies on that of KIP-114, the shuffling algorithm, and the pseudo random number generator.

- KIP-114 is unbiased because keccak256 hash is.
- The shuffling algorithm Fisher-Yates is unbiased as long as the pseudo random number generator is.
- To the best of our knowledge, the Golang's pseudo random number generator is unbiased; it uses [Additive Lagged Fibonacci Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagged_Fibonacci_generator) where initial values are generated by a [Linear Congruential Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator) based on the user seed.

### Predictability

The predictability of this proposal relies on that of KIP-114. See [link](https://github.com/klaytn/kips/blob/kip114/KIPs/kip-114.md#predictability).

## Implementation

A reference implementation in Golang: [link](https://github.com/ian0371/klaytn/tree/fork/proposer-selection-3).

Note that Golang's standard package [rand.shuffle](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/master:src/math/rand/rand.go;l=252) implements Fisher-Yates.

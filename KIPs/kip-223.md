## Abstract

Adjust Kaia’s transaction data (calldata) gas cost model to align with the two EIPs: [EIP-7623](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7623) for introducing calldata floor gas and [EIP-2028](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2028) for reducing calldata cost. By doing so, Kaia can achieve better compatibility with Ethereum’s post-Prague ecosystem and toolchain.

## Motivation

After Ethereum’s Prague hard fork, which includes [EIP-7623](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7623), many Ethereum-oriented tools and SDKs assume the updated calldata pricing model.
If Kaia maintained its previous gas cost rules, developers using Ethereum SDKs or tools (e.g. ERC-4337 bundlers) would encounter mismatches in gas estimates and transaction validity.
Adopting the [EIP-7623](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7623) calldata pricing model in Kaia eliminates these incompatibilities, allowing seamless use of Ethereum ecosystem software on Kaia.

## Specification

| Parameter | Value |
|-|-|
| `STANDARD_TOKEN_COST` | `4` |
| `TOTAL_COST_FLOOR_PER_TOKEN` | `10` |

Let `tokens_in_calldata = zero_bytes_in_calldata + nonzero_bytes_in_calldata * 4`.

Let `isContractCreation` be a boolean indicating the respective event.

Let `execution_gas_used` be the gas used for EVM execution with the gas refund subtracted.

Let `INITCODE_WORD_COST` be 2 as defined in [EIP-3860](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3860).

Let `tx_gas` be the base intrinsic gas for the transaction type (default 21000, additional 10000 for fee-delegated transactions or 15000 for fee-delegation with ratio transactions).

Let `sig_validate_gas` be the gas used for signature validation (gas used to verify signatures for fee-delegated transactions or AccountKey transactions).

```
tx.gasUsed = (
    tx_gas
    + sig_validate_gas
    + max(
        STANDARD_TOKEN_COST * tokens_in_calldata
        + execution_gas_used
        + isContractCreation * (32000 + INITCODE_WORD_COST * words(calldata)),
        TOTAL_COST_FLOOR_PER_TOKEN * tokens_in_calldata
    )
)
```

The transaction must pay at minimum `TOTAL_COST_FLOOR_PER_TOKEN * tokens_in_calldata` gas for the calldata portion via the floor cost. If the standard cost (including execution) is higher than the floor-based cost, that higher cost applies; otherwise, the floor cost takes precedence, ensuring data-heavy, low-compute transactions pay more.

## Rationale

Because Kaia supports multiple customized transaction types (e.g., fee-delegated transactions), intrinsic gas is split into `tx_gas` and `sig_validate_gas`. This ensures that gas used for the transaction type and signature validation is calculated separately. As a result, `tx_gas` and `sig_validate_gas` are outside of the maximum function, so that we can apply the floor cost only to the calldata portion.

Other than that, we follow the [EIP-7623](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7623) spec for the calldata gas cost calculation. The numbers in [EIP-7623](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7623) were chosen to reduce the maximum block size while minimizing the impact on regular transactions. However, Kaia does not impose a block gas limit, so that particular rationale does not apply here. Instead, we adopt these parameters primarily for compatibility with Ethereum.

## Backward Compatibility

The calldata gas repricing is backwards incompatible since the hardfork.

SDKs and Wallets will be able to continue their operations with no change as they usually depend on the estimated gas cost from the `eth_estimateGas` API.

## Simple Summary

New fields in the block header as the source of on-chain random

## Abstract

This standard outlines an approach for generating an on-chain random value based on digital signature. Specifically, it introduces new fields, namely `randomReveal` and `mixHash`, in the block header; `randomReveal` is a verifiable random number, and `mixHash` is a derivation from a mixture of `randomReveals` and additional information. They serve as an unpredictable, verifiable, and dependable source of on-chain randomness.

## Motivation

An unpredictable, verifiable, and dependable on-chain randomness can be utilized in various use-cases including the protocol and applications.

- Unpredictability indicates that the random should be as difficult to predict as possible.

- Verifiability ensures that the random is authentic and cannot be manipulated or forged.

- Dependability implies that the random is generated without trusting any external sources of randomness, such as oracles.

An example of such use-cases is the block proposer selection. An exemplary requirement can be that the next block's proposer remains undisclosed until the latest block has been finalized, or that the proposer cannot tamper with deciding the next block's proposer.

In this proposal, new header fields `randomReveal` and `mixHash` are introduced. `randomReveal` is the signature of the proposer, and `randomReveal`s are mixed to compute `mixHash`, which users can use for a part of the random source. `mixHash` is unpredictable, verifiable, and dependable:

- (Unpredictability) the signature is random and so is `mixHash`.
- (Verifiability) the signature can be verified with the public key of the proposer, and `mixHash` is computed in a deterministic manner.
- (Dependability) `mixHash` only relies on the validators.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

The terms hash_to_point (hereinafter referred to as hash), public key, proof-of-possession (hereinafter referred to as pop) are from the ciphersuite [BLS_SIG_BLS12381G2_XMD:SHA-256_SSWU_RO_POP\_](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature-05.html#section-4.2.3).

### Parameters

| Constant     | Value |
| ------------ | ----- |
| `FORK_BLOCK` | TBD   |

### Block Structure

Beginning with `FORK_BLOCK`, client software must set the fields in a block header:

- `randomReveal`: 96 bytes. It must be specified in the 15th field (0-indexed) of a block header.

- `mixHash`: 32 bytes. It must be specified in the 16th field (0-indexed) of a block header.

### Block Processing

#### Block Proposal

Beginning with `FORK_BLOCK`, the proposer must fill the new fields in the block proposal:

- `randomReveal`: The proposer must sign the hash of the proposing block number.

- `mixHash`: The proposer must XOR the keccak256 hash of `randomReveal` and the previous block's `mixHash`. If the previous block's `mixHash` is null (e.g., previous block is before `FORK_BLOCK`), then use 32 bytes of zero instead.

#### Validation

Beginning with `FORK_BLOCK`, validators must validate the new fields:

- `randomReveal`

  - The validators must fetch the public key and the pop of the proposer by `getInfo(cnNodeId)` of the BLS registry standardized by [KIP-113](https://github.com/klaytn/kips/blob/main/KIPs/kip-113.md#validation).
  - The validators must verify the validity of the proposer public key using pop as mentioned in [here](https://github.com/klaytn/kips/blob/main/KIPs/kip-113.md#validation).
  - The validators must verify if `randomReveal` is signed by the proposer public key.

- `mixHash`: The validators must verify the validity of the proposed `mixHash` by calculating `mixHash` using the aforementioned `mixHash` algorithm.

### Pseudocode

See the following pseudocode that describes the block processing in python:

```python
DEFAULT_MIXHASH = b"\x00" * 32

def fill_kip114_header(newHeader, prevHeader, privateKey):
    newHeader.randomReveal = calc_random_reveal(privateKey, newHeader.number)

    if newHeader.number == FORK_BLOCK:
        prevMixHash =  DEFAULT_MIXHASH
    else:
        prevMixHash = prevHeader.mixHash
    newHeader.mixHash = calc_mix_hash(prevMixHash, newHeader.randomReveal)

def calc_random_reveal(privateKey, headerNumber):
    return sign(privateKey, headerNumber)

def calc_mix_hash(prevMixHash, randomReveal):
    return xor(prevMixHash, keccak256(randomReveal))

def verify_kip114_header(header, prevHeader):
    [proposerPubkey, proposerPop] = getProposerPubkeyPop()
    # pop verify
    pop_verify(proposerPubkey, proposerPop)

    # signature verify
    if not verify(proposerPubkey, header.number, header.randomReveal):
        return False

    # mixHash verify
    if header.number == FORK_BLOCK:
        prevMixHash = DEFAULT_MIXHASH
    else:
        prevMixHash = prevHeader.mixHash
    return header.mixHash == calc_mix_hash(prevMixHash, header.randomReveal):
```

### Genesis Block

If `FORK_BLOCK` is zero, the genesis block must have `randomReveal` and `mixHash` fields.

## Rationale

### Names of the header fields

The naming is highly inspired by [EIP-4339](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4399).
We use `randomReveal` instead of RANDAO reveal because the randoms are generated in a different manner.

### Block size increment due to new fields in the header

The size increment cost of RLP-encoded header is around 131 bytes per block, which is approximately 3.8GB per year. It is a negligible cost compared to its benefit.

### BLS-based random over EC-based random

We chose BLS-based verifiable random over EC-based because:

- A BLS library written in Golang is easy to find as in [link](https://github.com/klaytn/klaytn/issues/1823), whereas it is not the case for EC-based as in [link](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-15.html#section-6).
- There is a potential consensus change based on BLS signature. Therefore, this proposal gently introduces BLS signature to the Klaytn protocol as well as adding on-chain randomness.

## Backwards Compatibility

Blocks before `FORK_BLOCK` will remain the same.

## Security Considerations

### Biasability

BLS signature as well as the signing message (i.e., proposing block number) is deterministic. Thus, the proposer has no influence over the computation of `mixHash`. In addition, the biasability of `mixHash` mainly depends on that of the hash of `randomReveal`. To the best of our knowledge, keccak256 is not a biased hash function. Therefore, `mixHash`, which is the XOR of the output of keccak256 and the previous `mixHash`, is unbiased.

### Predictability

`mixHash` of the block number `N` can be computed only when these values are revealed:

- `mixHash` of the block `N-1`.
- `randomReveal` of the block `N`.

Therefore, in theory, no one (including the proposer of the block `N`) can predict the value of `mixHash` of the block `N` before the block `N-1` has been finalized.

However, in reality, there is a possibility of collusion among validators that facilitates the prediction beyond the ideal situation. Specifically, colluding validators can share their `randomReveal`s in advance to enable the precomputation of `mixHash`. The extent to which colluding validators can predict depends on the number of consecutive blocks they collectively propose; the more the validators collude, the further they can predict. A single benign validator can disrupt the collusion, thereby limiting the predictable timeframe.

Define `f(x, numVals, numCols)` as the probability of `numCols` number of colluding validators, among `numVals` validators, conspiring to predict the value of `mixHash` `x` blocks in advance.
It implies that `numCols` number of colluding validators must become proposers for `x` consecutive blocks.

#### Before KIP-146

The proposer is selected in a round-robin manner; all validators get an equal chance to propose in each round. Users of this random should be aware that in the worst-case scenario where only a single validator remains benign, the colluding validators can predict the value of `mixHash` ahead by up to twice the number of colluding validators (i.e., when benign validator proposes first in the first round and last in the second round).
In other words, `f(x, numVals, numCols)` is zero when `x >= 2*numVals` and `numVals > numCols`.

#### After KIP-146

After KIP-146, the proposer is randomly selected after each block, thus `f(x, numVals, numCols) = (numCols/numVals)^x`.

### Tips for application developers

Before KIP-146, developers are advised to give a window of twice the number of validators between the commit and reveal block when using commit-reveal random schemes using `mixHash`.

After KIP-146, there is no theoretical bound to which `mixHash` becomes unpredictable. Here are some varying combinations of `N`, `C`, and `threshold`, which developers can refer to for choosing the security level.

| numVals | numCols | x where f(x, numVals, numCols) < 0.001 | x where f(x, numVals, numCols) < 0.0001 |

| 100     | 50      | 10                                     | 14                                      |

| 100     | 99      | 688                                    | 917                                     |

Here is the script for developers that wish to customize the variables:

```python
def f(x, numVals, numCols):
    return (numCols / numVals) ** x


def find(numVals, numCols, threshold):
    print(numVals, numCols, threshold)
    for x in range(10000000):
        if f(x, numVals, numCols) < threshold:
            return x
```
